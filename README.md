### Hi there, I'm Wojciech Karcz üëã

I‚Äôm a head of the makerspace called ‚ÄúWytw√≥rnia‚Äù in Copernicus Science Centre (Warsaw, Poland). My main job is conducting practical workshops for children, youth and adults related to the making, DIY, tinkering and design. Additionally, I participate in a number of R&D projects regarding the study of learning processes and the design of new educational tools.
- I am a materials engineer by education. I graduated from the Faculty of Materials Science and Engineering at the Warsaw University of Technology
- I‚Äôm a big fan of Arduino and Raspberry Pi, especially for educational applications as well as for the implementation of your own DIY projects
- In my work I use technologies such as: Python, Linux, Bash, HTML/CSS, SQL, REST API, Arduino Programming Language.
- Fun fact - I am a home brewer :) Even one of my beers won a nationwide competition. As a reward, it was brewed in a professional brewery based on my recipe.
