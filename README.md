### Hi there, I'm Wojciech Karcz 👋

I’m a Data Engineer at Bosch Digital.  
- 🎓 I am a materials engineer by education. I graduated from the Faculty of Materials Science at the Warsaw University of Technology.  
- 🤖 I’m a big fan of Arduino and Raspberry Pi, especially for educational applications and for the implementation of your own DIY projects.  
- ⚡️ In my work I use technologies such as: Python, Linux, Bash, SQL, GCP (BigQuery), Hadoop, PySpark, Jenkins, Docker.  
- 🍺 Fun fact - I am a home brewer :) Even one of my beers won a nationwide competition. As a reward, it was brewed in a professional brewery based on my recipe.
- 🎙 I have my own podcast "Nauka przez całe życie" about self-learning new skills.
